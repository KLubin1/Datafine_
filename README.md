# Datafine_
Repository for the Datafine Android mobile app


## Last Major Update: 5/03/21

## Description:
Datafine is a simple Android database management app (DBMS). It uses SQLite to store, retrieve and configure data. 

With it you can:
* Create your own tables with up to 4 unique columns
* Read, edit and delete table info
* Secure your tables with a password lock or read-only mode
* Unlimited table entries
* Search function for table entries

**Note:** Not sure why GitHub is detecting the majority of code as Java. It's Android, which is Java-based, but this was developed with Xamarin.Android and C#.
